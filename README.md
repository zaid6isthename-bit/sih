# On-Device Visual Perception for Light-Weight Browser Agents

**Smart India Hackathon — Problem Statement 26171**

A privacy-preserving perception layer that lets a browser agent *see* and *act* on a
live web page **while guaranteeing that personally identifiable information never leaves
the device**. Perception and redaction run entirely in the browser; a stateless server
receives only a sanitized, structured description of the page and returns a *validated
action* — never free-reign code.

> Full rationale, threat model, algorithms and evaluation are in **[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)**
> (the production design document). A rendered before/after of the privacy filter is in
> **[`REDACTION_VISUAL.md`](REDACTION_VISUAL.md)** — open
> **[`demo/redaction-visual.html`](demo/redaction-visual.html)** in any browser for the
> interactive version. Step-by-step run & test instructions live in
> **[`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md)**. This README is the quick operational guide.

**Design stance:** fail-closed privacy · DOM-primary / vision-secondary · closed-allowlist actions.

## Quick start

> The full, copy-pasteable run & test guide (Windows + macOS/Linux, troubleshooting,
> smoke tests) is in **[`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md)**. The essentials:

### 1. Reasoning server (mock mode — no model required)

```bash
cd server
uv sync                            # restores .venv from uv.lock (or: pip install -r requirements.txt)
uv run uvicorn main:app --port 8000   # http://localhost:8000/health
```

The default `PBA_BACKEND=mock` uses a deterministic heuristic planner, so the whole
loop runs with **zero external dependencies**. To attach a real vision-language model,
point at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
export PBA_BACKEND=vlm
export PBA_VLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/v1     # e.g. a vLLM server
export PBA_VLM_MODEL=Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

Or run a **routed chain with failover** — cloud UI-TARS first, local model as the
offline fallback (the air-gapped story is a config change, not a code change):

```bash
export PBA_BACKEND=auto
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export PBA_VLM_ROUTES='[
 {"name":"openrouter","base_url":"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  "model":"bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b","api_key_env":"OPENROUTER_API_KEY"},
 {"name":"local-vllm","base_url":"http://localhost:8001/v1",
  "model":"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct"}
]'
```

UI-TARS models get a dedicated adapter profile (native Thought→Action DSL parsed,
coordinates snapped to element ids, sensitive-field typing converted to local-vault
fills). See [`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md) for all env vars and
[`server/selftest.py`](server/selftest.py) for an offline verification suite.

### 2. Extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → select the `extension/` folder.
3. Open any page, click the extension, type a task (e.g. *“fill in the application”*), **Run**.
4. The popup shows the **privacy receipt**: what was detected, what was redacted, and
   whether the screenshot was allowed to leave the device.

MV3, no host permissions by default; `activeTab` scoping means the agent only perceives
the tab you point it at. Requires Chrome/Chromium **121+** (WebGPU + offscreen document).

### 3. Try it end-to-end on the demo page

```
open demo/index.html      # in the same Chrome profile (file:// is fine)
```

`demo/index.html` is a self-contained synthetic government form that plants **every**
signal the filter must catch — `type=password` / `autocomplete=cc-number` / `email` /
`tel` fields, visible **checksum-valid** Aadhaar/PAN/card/phone/OTP/IP text, two
skin-toned `<img>` **faces**, and a handwritten `<canvas>` **signature**. Point the
agent at it with a task like *“fill in my email and phone from my profile, then submit
the application”* and watch the privacy receipt. Full walkthrough: [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md).

### 4. Evaluation scorecard (Node 18+)

```bash
node eval/run_all.js
```

Regenerates the labeled dataset, runs every evaluator, and prints a scorecard mapped to
the five official metrics.

---

## Measured results (on the shipped code)

| # | Official metric | Weight | Result |
|---|-----------------|:------:|--------|
| 1 | Visual context accuracy | 25% | **micro-F1 0.95** (recall **1.00**, mean IoU **0.93**) over 11 labeled screen-truth scenes; faces P/R/F1 = 1.00; grounding-integrity OK |
| 2 | PII detection precision/recall | 20% | **F1 0.99** (P 0.99 / R 1.00) over 101 samples incl. checksum-invalid hard negatives |
| 3 | Redaction precision | 20% | **coverage-recall 1.00**, box-precision 1.00, mean IoU 0.70, over-redaction 0.28 |
| 4 | Client resource use (proxy) | 20% | **≈4,700 chars/ms** local scan, p50 ≈1.4 ms / p95 ≈2.7 ms |
| 5 | End-to-end latency | 15% | server `/plan` **p50 ≈16 ms** (mock backend, n=30) |

Run `node eval/run_all.js` to reproduce all five. The benchmark loads the **same**
detector modules that run in the browser — Metric #1 scores the exact
`detectSensitiveRegions` core the extension ships — so these numbers describe
production behavior, with no separate eval implementation to drift.

---

## Why this design

- **On-device vision for the pixels the DOM can't explain.** Faces and handwritten
  signatures exist only as pixels. A dependency-free CV core (YCbCr skin + dark-ink
  geometry, coarse-grid connected components) runs on a **WebGPU compute shader with a
  CPU fallback** — and the GPU path is trusted only after a runtime self-test matches
  the CPU output, so it degrades safely. Two vendored ONNX **YOLO** detectors
  (`yolov8n-face`, `yolo-signature`) add faces/signatures on top — faces union with the
  CV core, signatures replace the classical heuristic (see [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md)).
  The screenshot is withheld entirely if vision can't run on an image-bearing page.
- **Fail-closed privacy.** Recall is treated as a safety property (“when uncertain,
  redact”). High-risk categories are masked even below the confidence threshold, and if
  vision is unavailable on a page with images, the screenshot is withheld entirely.
- **Correctness through checksums.** Aadhaar (Verhoeff), cards (Luhn) and PAN (holder-type
  character) are *validated*, not shape-matched — which is how precision stays at 0.99
  while recall stays at 1.00 against deliberate hard negatives.
- **Prompt-injection defense.** Page text is untrusted *data*, never instructions. The
  model can only emit actions from a closed allowlist; the client and a server-side
  validator independently sanitize every plan.
- **Robust action loop.** Element-ID bridge + Set-of-Marks prompting, action validation
  against the live DOM, verify-after-act, loop detection, step budgets, destructive-action
  confirmation, and a local secret vault the model never sees.

See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the complete treatment.

## Browser support

| Browser | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Chrome / Chromium / Edge 121+** | **Verified target** | MV3 service worker + **offscreen document** host the WebGPU/canvas work; `minimum_chrome_version: 121`. |
| **Firefox** | **Shimmed & documented, not verified** | Entry points use `const ext = globalThis.browser \|\| globalThis.chrome`, so the WebExtension APIs are addressed uniformly. Firefox does **not** implement `chrome.offscreen`; the service worker **feature-detects** it and, when absent, **degrades to fail-closed text-only** (vision skipped, screenshot withheld, receipt marked `offscreen_unsupported_text_only`) instead of throwing. To get on-device *vision* on Firefox the compositing host must move to an extension **background page** — the vision core itself is portable (plain WebGPU/CPU), so that port is host plumbing, not algorithm work. We don't claim vision runs on Firefox until that fallback is built and tested. |

The Node-scored detector core, the checksum PII logic, fusion, policy and redaction
geometry are browser-independent and covered by the eval regardless of host.

---

## Status & honest gaps

- Detector (DOM + checksum-text + **on-device vision**), fusion, policy, redaction
  geometry and the full action-loop logic are **implemented and benchmarked**. All five
  metrics — including **#1 (visual context)** and **#5 (latency)** — are scored by
  `node eval/run_all.js` on the shipped code.
- The on-device **vision detector** (`vision/vision-detector.js`) ships a dependency-free
  CV core with a **WebGPU compute-shader path and a CPU fallback**. The GPU path is
  trusted only after a runtime probe reproduces the CPU classification, so it fails safe.
  Two ONNX **YOLO** detectors (`vision/vision-neural.js`: `yolov8n-face` + `yolo-signature`)
  activate once weights are vendored — a one-command step, `node tools/vendor-vision.mjs`
  (see [`docs/VENDORING.md`](docs/VENDORING.md) and the deep-dive [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md)).
  Faces union with the classical core; signatures replace its noisier heuristic. They warm
  up at init to hide cold-start, and `id_document` is plumbed end-to-end for a future model.
  The extension CSP forbids CDN loads, so vendoring is intentionally offline-first.
- **In-browser runtime of the WebGPU shader and `chrome.*` plumbing is not exercised in
  this environment.** It is covered by the Node-tested CPU core (identical algorithm),
  the GPU self-verification probe, syntax/byte checks, and the manual `demo/` page. We do
  not claim in-browser runtime numbers we didn't observe.
- **Firefox is shimmed and documented, not verified** — see *Browser support* above.
- Server decision logic is verified by standalone logic and a live `/plan` run (Metric
  #5); pointing at a real VLM needs `PBA_BACKEND=vlm` + an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
