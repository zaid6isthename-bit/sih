## Workflow Execution Guide

Follow the Mermaid flowchart above to execute the workflow. Each node type has specific execution methods as described below.

### Execution Methods by Node Type

- **Rectangle nodes (Sub-Agent: ...)**: Execute Sub-Agents
- **Diamond nodes (AskUserQuestion:...)**: Use the AskUserQuestion tool to prompt the user and branch based on their response
- **Diamond nodes (Branch/Switch:...)**: Automatically branch based on the results of previous processing (see details section)
- **Rectangle nodes (Prompt nodes)**: Execute the prompts described in the details section below
- **Rectangle nodes (Branch-Session: ...)**: Human-in-the-loop checkpoints — pause the workflow and guide the user into a Claude Code branch session (see Branch Session Node Details)

### Group Node Execution Tracking

This workflow contains group nodes. Before executing nodes within each group, call the `highlight_group_node` MCP tool on the `cc-workflow-studio` server to visually highlight the active group on the canvas.

| Group ID | Label |
|----------|-------|
| group-1 | 1. Fetch Issue |
| group-2 | 2. Confirm Understanding |
| group-3 | 3. Reproduce |
| group-5 | 4. Analysis & Effort Estimation |
| group-6-merged | 5. Code Fix & Verification |
| group-7 | 6. Retrospective & Knowledge Persistence |

Call example: `highlight_group_node({ groupNodeId: "<group-id>" })`

When the workflow completes, call `highlight_group_node({ groupNodeId: "" })` to clear the highlight.

## Sub-Agent Node Details

#### agent-file-investigation(Sub-Agent: agent-file-investigation)

**subagent_type**: explore

**Description**: Investigate codebase

**Prompt**:

```
Investigate files related to the issue.

## Tasks
1. Extract keywords from the issue description
2. Use Read/Grep/Glob tools to identify related files
3. Review code at problem areas
4. Analyze scope of impact and dependencies

## Required Output Format

**Related Files**
- `path/to/file.ts` (lines X-Y) — one-line role description

**Problem Areas**
- File: `path/to/file.ts`

Do not omit any section. If a section has no findings, explicitly write "None".
```

**Parallel Execution**: enabled

When executing this node, assess whether the task involves multiple independent areas or concerns.
If so, launch multiple agents of the same subagent_type in parallel — one per independent area.

Guidelines:
- Single area of concern → execute with 1 agent
- Multiple independent areas → spawn 1 agent per area, execute in parallel
- Wait for all agents to complete before proceeding to the next node
- Consolidate all agent results before passing to the next node

**Implementation Steps**
1. Step one (concrete action)
2. Step two
3. ...

Do not omit any section.
```

**Parallel Execution**: enabled

When executing this node, assess whether the task involves multiple independent areas or concerns.
If so, launch multiple agents of the same subagent_type in parallel — one per independent area.

Guidelines:
- Single area of concern → execute with 1 agent

## Required Output Format

**User Feedback Received**
- (summary of the issue reported by user)

**Files Changed (this iteration)**
- `path/to/file.ts` — what changed

**Follow-up Checks**
- [ ] Formatter passed

- **MEMORY.md**: record insights and decision criteria
- **CLAUDE.md**: add development rules and conventions

Omit destinations where no proposal is needed.
```

**Parallel Execution**: enabled

When executing this node, assess whether the task involves multiple independent areas or concerns.
If so, launch multiple agents of the same subagent_type in parallel — one per independent area.

Guidelines:
- Single area of concern → execute with 1 agent
- Multiple independent areas → spawn 1 agent per area, execute in parallel
- Wait for all agents to complete before proceeding to the next node
- Consolidate all agent results before passing to the next node

3. **MEMORY.md**: Append insights to the appropriate scope's MEMORY.md
4. **CLAUDE.md**: Append rules/conventions to the appropriate scope's CLAUDE.md

**Important:**
- Present the specific content to the user for final confirmation before writing
- Incorporate any corrections or additions from the user
- Do not write without explicit approval
```

**Parallel Execution**: enabled

When executing this node, assess whether the task involves multiple independent areas or concerns.
If so, launch multiple agents of the same subagent_type in parallel — one per independent area.

Guidelines:
- Single area of concern → execute with 1 agent

- Start the development server (if the project has one)
- Run the test suite
- Run the formatter/linter

## Step 3: Verification checklist
- [ ] The target feature works as expected
- [ ] No regression in related features
- [ ] No errors or warnings in console/logs
- [ ] The original reproduction steps no longer trigger the issue

## Step 4: Proceed
Once all checks pass, proceed to the next step.
If any check fails, choose "Additional fix needed" in the next question.
```
